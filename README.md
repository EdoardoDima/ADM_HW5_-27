# Homework_5

## Group nr. 27, composed by: Aguanno Irene, Di Martino Edoardo, Sciarra Francesco

## Contents of the repository:
- main.ipynb : main notebook with all the results for the functionalities and visualizations
- graph.py : This file contains all the basic and structural functions underlying  our project. As explained inside, a **class 'Graph'** is used to construct the graphs starting from the raw text files we downloaded from [this website](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/sx-stackoverflow.html).
 The class also collects some methods to retrieve interesting information about the graph, such as the **number of nodes and edges**, different **centrality measures** (in particular, **degree**, **closeness** and betweenness), if the graph is **directed** or **undirected**, etc. The functions **func_1** and **func_2** can be conveniently called to get a summary of these values. Further below, then, the file includes our implementations for the **Dijkstra** and the **Page Rank** algorithms.
